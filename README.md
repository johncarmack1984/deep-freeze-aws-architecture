# Deep Freeze AWS Infrastructure

Welcome to the AWS infrastructure repository for [Deep Freeze](https://github.com/johncarmack1984/deep-freeze)!

Originally, this repository housed a bash script designed for migrating DropBox files & folders to S3 deep storage. However, as the need for a more robust and stable solution grew, it evolved into a Rust project named "Deep Freeze." This project offers a solidified version of our repository's initial purpose.

Now, you'll find Terraform modules here, tailor-made for setting up the infrastructure needed for "Deep Freeze" on AWS.
